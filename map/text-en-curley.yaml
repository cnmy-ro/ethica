# Part 1

1D1: By cause of itself I understand that whose essence involves existence, or that whose nature cannot be conceived except as existing.
1D2: That thing is said to be finite in its own kind that can be limited by another of the same nature. For example, a body is called finite because we always conceive another that is greater. Thus a thought is limited by another thought. But a body is not limited by a thought nor a thought by a body.
1D3: By substance I understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself, that is, that whose concept does not require the concept of another thing, from which it must be formed.
1D4: By attribute I understand what the intellect perceives of a substance, as constituting its essence.
1D5: By mode I understand the affections of a substance, or that which is in another through which it is also conceived.
1D6: By God I understand a being absolutely infinite, that is, a substance consisting of an infinity of attributes, of which each one expresses an eternal and infinite essence.
1D7: That thing is called free which exists from the necessity of its nature alone, and is determined to act by itself alone. But a thing is called necessary, or rather compelled, which is determined by another to exist and to produce an effect in a certain and determinate manner.
1D8: By eternity I understand existence itself, insofar as it is conceived to follow necessarily from the definition alone of the eternal thing.

1A1: Whatever is, is either in itself or in another.
1A2: What cannot be conceived through another, must be conceived through itself.
1A3: From a given determinate cause the effect follows necessarily; and conversely, if there is no determinate cause, it is impossible for an effect to follow.
1A4: The knowledge of an effect depends on, and involves, the knowledge of its cause.
1A5: Things that have nothing in common with one another also cannot be understood through one another, or the concept of the one does not involve the concept of the other.
1A6: A true idea must agree with its object.
1A7: If a thing can be conceived as not existing, its essence does not involve existence.

1P1: A substance is prior in nature to its affections.
1P2: Two substances having different attributes have nothing in common with one another.
1P3: If things have nothing in common with one another, one of them cannot be the cause of the other.  
1P4: Two or more distinct things are distinguished from one another, either by a difference in the attributes of the substances or by a difference in their affections;
1P5: In Nature there cannot be two or more substances of the same nature or attribute.
1P6: One substance cannot be produced by another substance.
1P7: It pertains to the nature of a substance to exist.
1P8: Every substance is necessarily infinite.
1P9: The more reality or being each thing has, the more attributes belong to it.
1P10: Each attribute of a substance must be conceived through itself.
1P11: God, or a substance consisting of infinite attributes, each of which expresses eternal and infinite essence, necessarily exists.
1P12: No attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided.
1P13: A substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible.
1P14 : Except God, no substance can be or be conceived.
1P15: Whatever is, is in God, and nothing can be or be conceived without God.
1P16: From the necessity of the divine nature there must follow infinitely many things in infinitely many modes, (i.e., everything which can fall under an infinite intellect).
1P17: God acts from the laws of his nature alone, and is compelled by no one.
1P18: God is the immanent, not the transitive, cause of all things.
1P19: God is eternal, or all God's attributes are eternal.
1P20: God's existence and his essence are one and the same.
1P21: All the things which follow from the absolute nature of any of God's attributes have always had to exist and be infinite, or are, through the same attribute, eternal and infinite.
1P22: Whatever follows from some attribute of God insofar as it is modified by a modification which, through the same attribute, exists necessarily and is infinite, must also exist necessarily and be infinite.
1P23: Every mode which exists necessarily and is infinite has necessarily had to follow either from the absolute nature of some attribute of God, or from some attribute, modified by a modification which exists necessarily and is infinite.
1P24: The essence of things produced by God does not involve existence.
1P25: God is the efficient cause, not only of the existence of things, but also of their essence.
1P26: A thing which has been determined to produce an effect has necessarily been determined in this way by God; and one which has not been determined by God cannot determine itself to produce an effect.
1P27: A thing which has been determined by God to produce an effect, cannot render itself undetermined.
1P28: Every singular thing, or any thing which is finite and has a determinate existence, can neither exist nor be determined to produce an effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an effect by another cause, which is also finite and has a determinate existence; and again, this cause also can neither exist nor be determined to produce an effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an effect by another, which is also finite and has a determinate existence, and so on, to infinity.
1P29: In nature there is nothing contingent, but all things have been determined from the necessity of the divine nature to exist and produce an effect in a certain way.
1P30: An actual intellect, whether finite or infinite, must comprehend God's attributes and God's affections, and nothing else.
1P31: The actual intellect, whether finite or infinite, like will, desire, love, and the like, must be referred to Natura naturata, not to Natura naturans.
1P32: The will cannot be called a free cause, but only a necessary one.
1P33: Things could have been produced by God in no other way, and in no other order than they have been produced.
1P34: God's power is his essence itself.
1P35: Whatever we conceive to be in God's power, necessarily exists.
1P36: Nothing exists from whose nature some effect does not follow.

# Part 2: On the Nature and Origin of the Mind

2D1: By body I understand a mode that in a certain and determinate way expresses God's essence insofar as he is considered as an extended thing
2D2: "I say that to the essence of any thing belongs that which, being given, the thing is [NS: also] necessarily posited and which, being taken away, the thing is necessarily [NS: also] taken away; or that without which the thing can neither be nor be conceived, and which can neither be nor be conceived without the thing."
2D3: By idea I understand a concept of the mind which the mind forms because it is a thinking thing.
2D4: By adequate idea I understand an idea which, insofar as it is considered in itself, without relation to an object, has all the properties, or intrinsic denominations of a true idea.
2D5: Duration is an indefinite continuation of existing.
2D6: By reality and perfection I understand the same thing.
2D7: By singular things I understand things that are finite and have a determinate existence. And if a number of individuals so concur in one action that together they are all the cause of one effect, I consider them all, to that extent, as one singular thing.

2A1: The essence of man does not involve necessary existence, that is, from the order of Nature it can happen equally that this or that man does exist, or that he does not exist.
2A2: "Man thinks [NS: or, to put it differently, we know that we think]."
2A3: There are no modes of thinking, such as love, desire, or whatever is designated by the word affects of the mind, unless there is in the same individual the idea of the thing loved, desired, and the like. But there can be an idea, even though there is no other mode of thinking.
2A4: "We feel that a certain body [NS: our body] is affected in many ways."
2A5: "We neither feel nor perceive any singular things [NS: or anything of Natura naturata], except bodies and modes of thinking. See the postulates after PI 3."

2P1: Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a thinking thing.
2P2: Extension is an attribute of God, or God is an extended thing.
2P3: In God there is necessarily an idea, both of his essence and of everything which necessarily follows from his essence
2P4: Gods idea, from which infinitely many things follow in infinitely many modes, must be unique.
2P5: The formal being of ideas admits God as a cause only insofar as he is considered as a thinking thing, and not insofar as he is explained by any other attribute. That is, ideas, both of Gods attributes and of singular things, admit not the objects themselves, or the things perceived, as their efficient cause, but God himself, insofar as he is a thinking thing.
2P6: The modes of each attribute have God for their cause only insofar as he is considered under the attribute of which they are modes, and not insofar as he is considered under any other attribute.
2P7: The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.
2P8: The ideas of singular things, or of modes, that do not exist must be comprehended in Gods infinite idea in the same way as the formal essences of the singular things, or modes, are contained in Gods attributes.
2P9: "The idea of a singular thing which actually exists has God for a cause not insofar as he is infinite, but insofar as he is considered to be affected by another idea of a singular thing which actually exists; and of this [idea] God is also the cause, insofar as he is affected by another third [NS: idea], and so on, to infinity."
2P10: The being of substance does not pertain to the essence of man, or substance does not constitute the form of man.
2P11: The first thing which constitutes the actual being of a human Mind is nothing but the idea of a singular thing which actually exists.
2P12: Whatever happens in the object of the idea constituting the human mind must be perceived by the human mind, or there will necessarily be an idea of that thing in the mind; that is, if the object of the idea constituting a human mind is a body, nothing can happen in that body which is not perceived by the mind.
2P13: The object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body, or a certain mode of extension which actually exists, and nothing else.
2P13A1: All bodies either move or are at rest.
2P13A2: Each body moves now more slowly, now more quickly.
2P13L1: Bodies are distinguished from one another by reason of motion and rest, speed and slowness, and not by reason of substance.
2P13L2: All bodies agree in certain things.
2P13L3: A body which moves or is at rest must be determined to motion or rest by another body, which has also been determined to motion or rest by another, and that again by another, and so on, to infinity.
2P13L3A1: All modes by which a body is affected by another body follow both from the nature of the body affected and at the same time from the nature of the affecting body, so that one and the same body may be moved differently according to differences in the nature of the bodies moving it. And conversely, different bodies may be moved differently by one and the same body.
2P13L3A2: When a body in motion strikes against another which is at rest and cannot give way, then it is reflected, so that it continues to move, and the angle of the line of the reflected motion with the surface of the body at rest which it struck against will be equal to the angle which the line of the incident motion makes with the same surface.
2P13L3D1: When a number of bodies, whether of the same or of different size, are so constrained by other bodies that they lie upon one another, or if they so move, whether with the same degree or different degrees of speed, that they communicate their motions to each other in a certain fixed manner, we shall say that those bodies are united with one another and that they all together compose one body or individual, which is distinguished from the others by this union of bodies.
2P13L3A3: As the parts of an individual, or composite body, lie upon one another over a larger or smaller surface, so they can be forced to change their position with more or less difficulty; and consequently the more or less will be the difficulty of bringing it about that the individual changes its shape. And therefore the bodies whose parts lie upon one another over a large surface, I shall call hard-, those whose parts lie upon one another over a small surface, I shall call soft; and finally those whose parts are in motion, I shall call fluid.
2P13L4: "If, of a body, or of an individual, which is composed of a number of bodies, some are removed, and at the same time as many others of the same nature take their place, the [NS: body, or the] individual will retain its nature, as before, without any change of its form."
2P13L5: If the parts composing an individual become greater or less, but in such a proportion that they all keep the same ratio of motion and rest to each other as before, then the individual will likewise retain its nature, as before, without any change of form.
2P13L6: If certain bodies composing an individual are compelled to alter the motion they have from one direction to another, but so that they can continue their 11/101 motions and communicate them to each other in the same ratio as before, the individual will likewise retain its nature, without any change of form.
2P13L7: Furthermore, the individual so composed retains its nature, whether it, as a whole, moves or is at rest, or whether it moves in this or that direction, so long as each part retains its motion, and communicates it, as before, to the others.
2Post1: The human body is composed of a great many individuals of different natures, each of which is highly composite. 
2Post2: Some of the individuals of which the human body is composed are fluid, some soft, and others, finally, are hard.
2Post3: The individuals composing the human body, and consequently, the human body itself, are affected by external bodies in very many ways.
2Post4: The human body, to be preserved, requires a great many other bodies, by which it is, as it were, continually regenerated.
2Post5: When a fluid part of the human body is determined by an external body so that it frequently thrusts against a soft part [of the body], it changes its surface and, as it were, impresses on [the soft part] certain traces of the external body striking against [the fluid part].
2Post6: The human body can move and dispose external bodies in a great many ways.
2P14: The human mind is capable of perceiving a great many things, and is the more capable, the more its body can be disposed in a great many ways.
2P15: The idea that constitutes the formal being [esse] of the human mind is not simple, but composed of a great many ideas.
2P16: The idea of any mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies must involve the nature of the human body and at the same time the nature of the external body.
2P17: If the human body is affected with a mode that involves the nature of an external body, the human mind will regard the same external body as actually existing, or as present to it, until the body is affected by an affect that excludes the existence or presence of that body.
2P18: If the human body has once been affected by two or more bodies at the same time, then when the mind subsequently imagines one of them, it will immediately recollect the others also.
2P19: The human mind does not know the human body itself, nor does it know that it exists, except through ideas of affections by which the body is affected.
2P20: There is also in God an idea, or knowledge, of the human mind, which follows in God in the same way and is related to God in the same way as the idea, or knowledge, of the human body.
2P21: This idea of the mind is united to the mind in the same way as the mind is united to the body.
2P22: The human mind perceives not only the affections of the body, but also the ideas of these affections.
2P23: The mind does not know itself except insofar as it perceives the ideas of the affections of the body.
2P24: The human mind does not involve adequate knowledge of the parts composing the human body.
2P25: The idea of any affection of the human body does not involve adequate knowledge of an external body.
2P26: The human mind does not perceive any external body as actually existing, except through the ideas of the affections of its own body.
2P27: The idea of any affection of the human body does not involve adequate knowledge of the human body itself.
2P28: The ideas of the affections of the human body, insofar as they are related only to the human mind, are not clear and distinct, but confused.
2P29: The idea of the idea of any affection of the human body does not involve adequate knowledge of the human mind.
2P30: We can have only an entirely inadequate knowledge of the duration of our body.
2P31: We can have only an entirely inadequate knowledge of the duration of the singular things which are outside us.
2P32: All ideas, insofar as they are related to God, are true.
2P33: There is nothing positive in ideas on account of which they are called false.
2P34: Every idea which in us is absolute, or adequate and perfect, is true.
2P35: Falsity consists in the privation of knowledge which inadequate, or mutilated and confused, ideas involve.
2P36: Inadequate and confused ideas follow with the same necessity as adequate', or clear and distinct ideas.
2P37: What is common to all things (on this see L2, above) and is equally in the part and in the whole, does not constitute the essence of any singular thing.
2P38: Those things which are common to all, and which are equally in the part and in the whole, can only be conceived adequately.
2P39: If something is common to, and peculiar to, the human body and certain external bodies by which the human body is usually affected, and is equally in the part and in the whole of each of them, its idea will also be adequate in the mind.
2P40: Whatever ideas follow in the mind from ideas which are adequate in the mind are also adequate.
2P41: Knowledge of the first kind is the only cause of falsity', whereas knowledge of the second and of the third kind is necessarily true.
2P42: Knowledge of the second and third kinds, and not of the first kind, teaches us to distinguish the true from the false.
2P43: He who has a true idea at the same time knows that he has a true idea, and cannot doubt the truth of the thing.
2P44: It is of the nature of reason to regard things as necessary, not as contingent.
2P45: Each idea of each body, or of each singular thing which actually exists, necessarily involves an eternal and infinite essence of God.
2P46: The knowledge of God's eternal and infinite essence which each idea involves is adequate and perfect.
2P47: The human mind has an adequate knowledge of Gods eternal and infinite essence.
2P48: In the mind there is no absolute, or free, will, but the mind is determined to will this or that by a cause which is also determined by another, and this again by another, and so to infinity.
2P49: In the mind there is no volition, or affirmation and negation, except that which the idea involves insofar as it is an idea.

# Part 3: Of the Origin and Nature of the Affects

3D1: I call that cause adequate whose effect can be clearly and distinctly perceived through it. But I call it partial, or inadequate, if its effect cannot be understood through it alone. 
3D2: I say that we act when something happens, in us or outside us, of which we are the adequate cause, that is (by Dl), when something in us or outside us follows from our nature, which can be clearly and distinctly understood through it alone. On the other hand, I say that we are acted on when something happens in us, or something follows from our nature, of which we are only a partial cause.
3D3: By affect I understand affections of the body by which the body's power of acting is increased or diminished, aided or restrained, and at the same time, the ideas of these affections.

3Post1: The human body can be affected in many ways in which its power of acting is increased or diminished, and also in others which render its power of acting neither greater nor less.
3Post2: The human body can undergo many changes, and nevertheless retain impressions, or traces, of the objects (on this see IPost5), and consequently, the same images of things. (For the definition of images, see IIP17S.)

3P1: Our mind does certain things [acts] and undergoes other things, namely, insofar as it has adequate ideas, it necessarily does certain things, and insofar as it has inadequate ideas, it necessarily undergoes other things
3P2: The body cannot determine the mind to thinking, and the mind cannot determine the body to motion, to rest, or to anything else (if there is anything else).
3P3: The actions of the mind arise from adequate ideas alone; the passions depend on inadequate ideas alone.
3P4: No thing can be destroyed except through an external cause.
3P5: Things are of a contrary nature, that is, cannot be in the same subject, insofar as one can destroy the other.
3P6: Each thing, as far as it can by its own power, strives to persevere in its being.
3P7: The striving by which each thing strives to persevere in its being is nothing but the actual essence of the thing.
3P8: The striving by which each thing strives to persevere in its being involves no finite time, but an indefinite time.
3P9: Both insofar as the mind has clear and distinct ideas, and insofar as it has confused ideas, it strives, for an indefinite duration, to persevere in its being and it is conscious of this striving it has.
3P10: An idea that excludes the existence of our body cannot be in our mind, but is contrary to it.
3P11: The idea of any thing that increases or diminishes, aids or restrains, our body's power of acting, increases or diminishes, aids or restrains, our minds power of thinking.
3P12: The mind as far as it can, strives to imagine those things that increase or aid the body s power of acting.
3P13: When the mind imagines those things that diminish or restrain the body's power of acting, it strives, as far as it can, to recollect things which exclude their existence.
3P14: If the mind has once been affected by two affects at once, then afterwards, when it is affected by one of them, it will also be affected by the other.
3P15: Any thing can be the accidental cause of joy, sadness, or desire.
3P16: From the mere fact that we imagine a thing to have some likeness to an object which usually affects the mind with joy or sadness, we love it or hate it, even though that in which the thing is like the object is not the efficient cause of these affects.
3P17: If we imagine that a thing which usually affects us with an affect of sadness is like another which usually affects us with an equally great affect of joy, we shall hate it and at the same time love it.
3P18: Man is affected with the same affect of joy or sadness from the image of a past or future thing as from the image of a present thing.
3P19: He who imagines that what he loves is destroyed will be saddened; but he who imagines it to be preserved, will rejoice.
3P20: He who imagines that what he hates is destroyed will rejoice.
3P21: He who imagines what he loves to be affected with joy or sadness will also be affected with joy or sadness; and each of those affects will be greater or lesser in the lover as they are greater or lesser in the thing loved.
3P22: If we imagine someone to affect with joy a thing we love, we shall be affected with love toward him. If, on the other hand, we imagine him to affect the same thing with sadness, we shall also be affected with hate toward him.
3P23: He who imagines what he hates to be affected with sadness will rejoice; if, on the other hand, he should imagine it to be affected with joy, he will be saddened. And both these affects will be the greater or lesser, as its contrary is greater or lesser in what he hates.
3P24: If we imagine someone to affect with joy a thing we hate, we shall be affected with hate toward him also. On the other hand, if we imagine him to affect the same thing with sadness, we shall be affected with love toward him.
3P25: We strive to affirm, concerning ourselves and what we love, whatever we imagine to affect with joy ourselves or what we love. On the other hand, we strive to deny whatever we imagine affects with sadness ourselves or what we love.
3P26: We strive to affirm, concerning what we hate, whatever we imagine to affect it with sadness, and on the other hand, to deny whatever we imagine to affect it with joy.
3P27: If we imagine a thing like us, toward which we have had no affect, to be affected with some affect, we are thereby affected with a like affect.
3P28: We strive to further the occurrence of whatever we imagine will lead to joy, and to avert or destroy what we imagine is contrary to it, or will lead to sadness.
3P29: We shall strive to do also whatever we imagine men to look on with joy, and on the other hand, we shall be averse to doing what we imagine men are averse to.
3P30: If someone has done something which he imagines affects others with joy, he will be affected with joy accompanied by the idea of himself as cause, or he will regard himself with joy. If on the other hand, he has done something which he imagines affects others with sadness, he will regard himself with sadness.
3P31: "If we imagine that someone loves, desires, or hates something we ourselves love, desire, or hate, we shall thereby love, desire, or hate it with greater constancy. But if we imagine that he is averse to what we love, or the opposite [NS: that he loves what we hate], then we shall undergo vacillation of mind."
3P32: If we imagine that someone enjoys some thing that only one can possess, we shall strive to bring it about that he does not possess it.
3P33: When we love a thing like ourselves, we strive, as far as we can, to bring it about that it loves us in return.
3P34: The greater the affect with which we imagine a thing we love to be affected toward us, the more we shall exult at being esteemed.
3P35: If someone imagines that a thing he loves is united with another by as close, or by a closer, bond of friendship than that with which he himself, alone, possessed the thing, he will be affected with hate toward the thing he loves, and will envy the other.
3P36: He who recollects a thing by which he was once pleased desires to possess it in the same circumstances as when he first was pleased by it.
3P37: The desire which arises from sadness or joy, and from hatred or love, is greater, the greater the affect is.
3P38: If someone begins to hate a thing he has loved, so that the love is completely destroyed, then (from an equal cause) he will have a greater hate for it than if he had never loved it, and this hate will be the greater as the love before was greater.
3P39: He who hates someone will strive to do evil to him, unless he fears that a greater evil to himself will arise from this; and on the other hand, he who loves someone will strive to benefit him by the same law.
3P40: He who imagines he is hated by someone, and believes he has given the other no cause for hate, will hate the other in return.
3P41: If someone imagines that someone loves him, and does not believe he has given any cause for this, he will love [that person] in return.
3P42: He who has benefited someone—whether moved to do so by love or by the hope of esteem—will be saddened if he sees his benefit accepted in an ungrateful spirit.
3P43: Hate is increased by being returned, but can be destroyed by love.
3P44: Hate completely conquered by love passes into love, and the love is therefore greater than if hate had not preceded it.
3P45: If someone imagines that someone like himself is affected with hate toward a thing like himself which he loves, he will hate that [person].
3P46: If someone has been affected with joy or sadness by someone of a class, or nation, different from his own, and this joy or sadness is accompanied by the idea of that person as its cause, under the universal name of the class or nation, he will love or hate, not only that person, but everyone of the same class or nation.
3P47: The joy which arises from our imagining that a thing we hate is destroyed, or affected with some other evil, does not occur without some sadness of mind.
3P48: Love or hate—say, of Peter—is destroyed if the sadness the hate involves, or the joy the love involves, is attached to the idea of another cause, and each is diminished to the extent that we imagine that Peter was not its only cause.
3P49: Given an equal cause of love, love toward a thing will be greater if we imagine the thing to be free than if we imagine it to be necessary. And similarly for hate.
3P50: Anything whatever can be the accidental cause of hope or fear.
3P51: Different men can be affected differently by one and the same object; and one and the same man can be affected differently at different times by one and the same object.
3P52: If we have previously seen an object together with others, or we imagine it has nothing but what is common to many things, we shall not consider it so long as one which we imagine to have something singular.
3P53: When the mind considers itself and its power of acting, it rejoices, and does so the more, the more distinctly it imagines itself and its power of acting.
3P54: The mind strives to imagine only those things which posit its power of acting.
3P55: When the mind imagines its own lack of power, it is saddened by it.
3P56: There are as many species of joy, sadness, and desire, and consequently of each affect composed of these (like vacillation of mind) or derived from them (like love, hate, hope, fear, etc.), as there are species of objects by which we are affected.
3P57: Each affect of each individual differs from the affect of another as much as the essence of the one from the essence of the other.
3P58: Apart from the joy and desire which are passions, there are other affects of joy and desire which are related to us insofar as we act.
3P59: Among all the affects which are related to the mind insofar as it acts, there are none which are not related to joy or desire.

3Aff1: Desire is man's very essence, insofar as it is conceived to be determined, from any given affection of it, to do something.
3Aff2: Joy is a man's passage from a lesser to a greater perfection.
3Aff3: Sadness is a man's passage from a greater to a lesser perfection
3Aff4: Wonder is an imagination of a thing in which the mind remains fixed because this singular imagination has no connection with the others. (See P52 and P52S.)
3Aff5: Disdain is an imagination of a thing which touches the mind so little that the thing's presence moves the mind to imagining more what is not in it than what is. (See P52S).
3Aff6: Love is a joy, accompanied by the idea of an external cause
3Aff7: Hate is a sadness, accompanied by the idea of an external cause.
3Aff8: Inclination is a joy accompanied by the idea of a thing which is the accidental cause of joy.
3Aff9: Aversion is a sadness accompanied by the idea of something which is the accidental cause of sadness. (On this see P15S.)
3Aff10: Devotion is a love of one whom we wonder at.
3Aff11: Mockery is a joy born of the fact that we imagine something we disdain in a thing we hate.
3Aff12: Hope is an inconstant joy, born of the idea of a future or past thing whose outcome we to some extent doubt.
3Aff13: Fear is an inconstant sadness, born of the idea of a future or past thing whose outcome we to some extent doubt. (See P18S2.)
3Aff14: Confidence is a joy born of the idea of a future or past thing, concerning which the cause of doubting has been removed.
3Aff15: Despair is a sadness born of the idea of a future or past thing concerning which the cause of doubting has been removed.
